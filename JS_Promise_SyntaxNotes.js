/* LEARNING TO USE PROMISE OBJECTS IN JAVASCRIPT:
A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, 
or a reason that itâ€™s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). 
A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. 
Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.

Promises are eager, meaning that a promise will start doing whatever task you give it 
as soon as the promise constructor is invoked.

// Basic Constructor syntax for a promise object is:

let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    //excutor code
})

// When `new Promise` is created, it runs automatically.

// The arguments `resolve` and `reject` are callbacks provided by JS.
